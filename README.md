# Sunnyside agency landing page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The project

In this project I build out this **landing page**

This project focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
  - addEventListener()
  - querySelector()
